# Identifying risks and barriers
{: #risks}

A solid risk management plan, including identification of potential barriers, is essential to a successful transition.
{: shortdesc}

1. Per project, after a strategy is determined, identify workload-specific risks or barriers.
   - Technical challenges might include availability concerns, data sync issues, encryption, application technical limitations, and so on.
   - Nontechnical challenges might include data protection or compliance concerns (for example, GDPR), cost, timing (avoid peak loads), training, org impacts, resourcing, and so on.
1. Develop risk mitigation strategies.
   - For example, ensure that migrated data remains encrypted, donâ€™t touch live workloads during sync, plan any reorganizations, providing training, and so on.
1. Ensure the plan, including the risk mitigation, is documented for each transition project.

## Common challenges
{: #challenges}

- Live data is not easy to migrate.
   - Data in active applications is changing rapidly and thus cannot be easily migrated through backup and restore.
- Applications and infrastructure deployment is not automated.
   - Automation to redeploy is not available or not suitable.
- Applications contain hardcoded references.
   - Applications refer to specific IP or DNS or other addresses that make setting up a parallel deployment difficult.
   - Applications refer to specific service or user identities that are account-specific make moving to a new account difficult.
- Joining multiple VPCs with transit gateways can be complicated by problems with overlapping address spaces and poor network ACLs.
